I have taken the classes Intro to Embedded and Computer Architecture. I also took a lab last semester in FPGA design. These gave me experience in C/C++, TI tools, VHDL, and Assembly. I also had an internship last summer that dealt with writting code on an ARM processor. I also have experience with python, C# and java.
One of the original reasons I wanted to study computer engineering was the idea of combigning the hand-on work with hardware while also learning the software aspect of them. I found that embedded systems are the perfect marriage of those ideas. Testing and prototyping with a physical board has that hands-on work that I enjoy. After taking intro to embedded last year I decided that I wanted to learn more about it. I really just want to get more experience with embedded systems and see what other things that they are capable of.
