I have experience with IoT devices such as Arduino, RPi, and the STM32F4 Discovery board. I wrote a fuzzer while interning at NASA to fuzz the command and data handling capability of a custom satellite flight computer based on the stm32f4 chip. On a separate project I programmed an arduino-based electronics system to deploy an inflatable for hypersonic de-acceleration, this was for a 2U satellite platform. I worked on creating a headless wardriving RPi for wireless network information capture. I configured a RPi with PiHole, a home network DNS that drops all DNS requests to ad servers from your home network, effectively disabling adverts on all of your devices at the network level. I also built three racing quadcopters, though I did only configuration and none of the programming. Also at NASA, I redesigned the electrical system for an experient to measure g-forces and material structural properties upon launch of an experiment aboard a sounding rocket. I have experience with C++ and C, but those skills have atrophied over the last couple years, as I've been primarily using Python.
I'm excited to take this class because of the exposure to RTOS and the chance to work with embedded systems at a lower level. By the end of this course, I hope to be comfortable working with and programming functionality of embedded systems.
