I have little experience with embedded systems. My introduction to engineering group used a raspberry pi and I took the introduction to embedded systems class with Professor Dugan.

I enjoy interating with my code in non keyboard/mouse ways. Embedded systems often have different inputss and outputs that I'm excited to learn about and play with.
