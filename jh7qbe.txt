have next to no practical experience with embedded systems/programming -- have taken COA1+2, though, so (hopefully?) have some relevant conceptual knowledge

hello! my major interests are programming + languages. I took COA/computer architecture last semester and enjoyed it; I signed up for this class hoping it would be something like a continuation/practical application of COA.
