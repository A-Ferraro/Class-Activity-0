Matthew Bain (Mtb5te)
My background in embedded systems is simultaneously not as much as I would like and more than I ever expected it to be.I took professor DeLong's embedded class and loved it, and that inspired me to buy an arduino and pursue a career in embedded systems.My internship the summer of 2020 would have been very hands on in the embedded system world, but due to COVID, I only got to see an overview of the projects that my team was working on and was unable to contribute. I am very interested, but I am very inexperienced. 

In this class, I expect to gain a deeper knowlede within the application of embedded systems. More than anything, I want "hands on" knowledge that can assist me after graduation and make me a contributing member of the team. I am really interested in secure navigation in terms of embedded systems, so I am excited to see how this class helps me pursue that interest. Outside of class, I am interested in cooking, exercise, yoga, board games, and occasionally video games. If anyone wants to have zoom meeting where we hang out and talk about any of the above, just let me know!
